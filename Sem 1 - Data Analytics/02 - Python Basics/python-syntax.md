# Python for Data Analytics (1)

## Welcome Message
Welcome my dear data associates. You would be embarking into the wonderful life of python! We hope that by the end of this course, you would be able to have achieve the following

- [ ] Basic Arithemtic Functions in Python
- [ ] Strings and Printing
- [ ] Understanding Variables and Datatypes
- [ ] Booleans and Comparisons
- [ ] Lists (basics)
- [ ] Conditional Statements
- [ ] Logical Operators
- [ ] Looping (For, While). 
- [ ] Creating you own Functions


## Before we get started
Make sure that you have installed Anaconda, or python. If you haven't please follow [this link](../01 - Basics of Analytics/anaconda-ipython.md) to get into the instructions for how to download Anaconda. Also note that for this course, we would primarily be using Spyder. However, this and next week would probably be the only time in which you guys would be using Spyder, and we would move into a much more "data-analytics" friendly development enviroment. 

**For those who just started programming,** I would like to tell you that the journey is going to be a tough, but believe me, it is going to be quite rewarding. Do note that this week would be very heavy for you guys . If you are struggling, may I suggest that you do the following - 1. State in the group that you wish to have a Python enrichment lesson over the weekends, 2. Request help from someone in the group, 3. Learn by yourself over the weekends.


**For people who think you already know python**, please use *this link (not released yet)* for a Python Checklist, if you able to complete everything without the need of googling, you may try either the mini projects or you can try more advanced topics of Data Analytics. But **PLEASE donâ€™t neglect your group if they are able to understand or not occasionally.**

## Getting Started

# Python Basics
For this week, we would be primarily using resources from 3 places, TheNewBoston, ProgrammingKnowledge and [Automating the Boring Stuff with Python](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4co3D7kCi9oQ1NyR0I1LTFGVVE). I would suggest that **the best resource for you to use, is actually ProgrammingKnowledge if you are relatively new to programming. **

# External Resources
## Web Scrapping (Recommended)
Web Scrapping is an important concept that is most likely going to be covered at the later part of the course. Howver, if you do want to learn web scrapping in your free time. You can follow this person's tutorials. The library which you would be using is BeautifulSoup4.

## GUI Creation 
GUI Creation is very important for some organisations, which internet or the need to spend money for a website may be an issue. As such, you can create a GUI to serve a certain need. An example of Gui is as follows:

>img 1

>img 2

You can follow this person's tutorials. The library which you would be using is Tkinter.
