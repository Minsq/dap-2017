#### What is a Sample Survey?
>A survey is a data collection method where you select a sample of respondents from a large population in order to gather information about that population. 
>
>The process of identifying individuals from the population who you will interview is known as sampling.
>
> -- [<cite>Albert Blog - Data Collection Methods</cite>](https://www.albert.io/blog/data-collection-methods-statistics/)

#### What are some considerations to think about when gathering data through a survey?
When creating the questionnaire, one should consider the following:
- Ambiguity
    >First, make sure the questions and choices are unambiguous.
    >
    > -- [<cite>Albert Blog - Data Collection Methods</cite>](https://www.albert.io/blog/data-collection-methods-statistics/)

- Speed of completion
    > Second, make sure the questionnaire will be completed within a reasonable amount of time. 
    >
    > -- [<cite>Albert Blog - Data Collection Methods</cite>](https://www.albert.io/blog/data-collection-methods-statistics/)
- Typos
    >Finally, make sure there are no typographical errors.

#### What is pre-testing a survey?
>To check if there are any problems with your questionnaire, use it to interview a few people before administering it to all respondents in your sample. We refer to this process as pretesting.
>
> -- [<cite>Albert Blog - Data Collection Methods</cite>](https://www.albert.io/blog/data-collection-methods-statistics/)

#### What are some shortcomings of surveys?
>A major shortcoming of surveys occurs when you fail to select a sample correctly; without an appropriate sample, the results will not accurately generalize the population.

<!--I'm unsure if in-person interviews should be included in this section. Maybe should be limited to a shorter consolidated explanation?
-->

#### What are In-person Interviews?
>This technique has excellent response rates and enables you to conduct interviews that take a longer amount of time. Another benefit is you can ask follow-up questions to responses that are not clear.
>
>First, this method is expensive and takes more time because of interviewer training, transport, and remuneration. 
>
> -- [<cite>Albert Blog - Data Collection Methods</cite>](https://www.albert.io/blog/data-collection-methods-statistics/)

<!--I'm unsure if telephone interviews should be included in this section. Maybe should be limited to a shorter consolidated explanation?
-->

####  What are Telephone Interviews?
>Using this technique, you call respondents over the phone and interview them. 
>
>This method offers the advantage of quickly collecting data, especially when used with computer-assisted telephone interviewing. 
>
>Another advantage is that collecting data via telephone is cheaper than in-person interviewing.
>
>One of the main limitations with telephone interviewing it’s hard to gain the trust of respondents. Due to this reason, you may not get responses or may introduce bias. 
>
>Since phone interviews are generally kept short to reduce the possibility of upsetting respondents, this method may also limit the amount of data you can collect.
>

<!--I'm unsure if online interviews should be included in this section. Maybe should be limited to a shorter consolidated explanation?
-->


#### What are Online Interviews?
>With online interviewing, you send an email inviting respondents to participate in an online survey.
>
>This technique is used widely because it is a low-cost way of interviewing many respondents. 
>
>Another benefit is anonymity; you can get sensitive responses that participants would not feel comfortable providing with in-person interviewing.
>
>When you use online interviewing, you face the disadvantage of not getting a representative sample.
>

<!--I'm unsure if Mailed Questionnaires should be included in this section. Maybe should be limited to a shorter consolidated explanation?
-->

#### What are Mailed Questionnaires?
> ... you send a printed questionnaire to the postal address of the respondent.
>
>The participants fill in the questionnaire and mail it back. 
>
>... gives you the advantage of obtaining information that respondents may be unwilling to give when interviewing in person.
>
>... you are likely to get a low response rate.
>
>... inaccuracy in mailing address, delays or loss of mail could also affect the response rate.
>
>... cannot be used to interview respondents with low literacy
>
> ... cannot seek clarifications on responses.
>
> -- [<cite>Albert Blog - Data Collection Methods</cite>](https://www.albert.io/blog/data-collection-methods-statistics/)



<!--I'm unsure if Focus Group should be included in this section. Maybe should be limited to a shorter consolidated explanation?
-->
#### What are Focus Groups?
>When you use a focus group as a data collection method, you identify a group of 6 to 10 people with similar characteristics. A moderator then guides a discussion to identify attitudes and experiences of the group. The responses are captured by video recording, voice recording or writing—this is the data you will analyze to answer your research questions. 
>
>Focus groups have the advantage of requiring fewer resources and time as compared to interviewing individuals.
>
>...you can request clarifications to unclear responses.
>
>One disadvantage you face when using focus groups is that the sample selected may not represent the population accurately.
>
>...dominant participants can influence the responses of others.
