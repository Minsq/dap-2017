# Exploratory Data Analytics - Analytics Basics Mini Project

## Learning Objectives

- [ ] I know how to apply the Data Science Process.
- [ ] I am able to select the correct visualization charts for the correct situation.


## Preparations
Proceed to http://bit.ly/2ucJzrr and create a new doc. Inside this doc, we're going to type our answers for this mini project. 
As you answer the guided questions, record them down in the doc and take it as you've checked the checkboxes!
Each question will be given an answer template to aid your answers.


## Let's Get Started

Try to visualise a problem that you have recently faced. It could be a bad experience at a food court: you had to wait longer than 15 minutes to order a cup of drink!

- [ ] What is the problem that I would like to analyse?
	- E.g.
		> Waiting a long time to order at the food court is a problem.
		
		or
		> There are always dirty tables at the food court.

		or
		> I always get wet when walking in the rain from Building A to Building B.

Now think of the processes that are underlying that situation and ask yourself why that happened. For instance, in the case of your bad experience at a food court:

1. Who is serving the queue?
2. How many staff were there?
3. How did they take an order? 
4. How did they complete the order?
5. What could be the reasons why they are so slow!?

**Remember:** you need as much context as possible to turn your data into insights later on

- [ ] I have come up with a set of interesting questions to explore

## Let's Explore The Data

For each of the questions you have generated above. Think of what kind of data you can collect. How would you collect or find it (online or offline)?

- [ ] I have thought of what kind of data to collect
	- [ ] I have recorded down what are the columns of the dataset I would acquire
	- [ ] I have recorded down what are the possible values of each column

- [ ] I know how I would collect or find the data

As you do this, you would expect some hiccups. What are some problems that may occur based on the readings you have gone through earlier? Do you know how to solve them?

- [ ] I know what are the problems that may occur
- [ ] I know what are the techniques or tools I can use to address these problems

### Can you visualize it?

For each column of the data you have recorded down above, can you picture of how you would apply the [appropriate graphical techniques](https://github.com/smubia/curriculum/blob/master/exploratory-data-analytics-py/1-analytics-basics/Intro-to-Data-Analytics.md#exploratory-data-analysis---learn-from-your-data) to make sense of them?

Do you know if that works? What are some of the strengths and flaws for each of the column?

- [ ] I have recorded down which techniques I would use for each column
- [ ] I have recorded down the strengths and flaws of the method I have used for each column
