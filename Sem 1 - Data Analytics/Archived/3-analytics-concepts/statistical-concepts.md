#### What is the difference between Nominal, Ordinal, Interval, and Ratio scales?
We should also always be mindful of the scales that apply to our different datasets, as it would affect what statistical techiques we apply during our analysis.

There are 4 types of scales:
1. Nominal/Categorical
    >A categorical variable, also called a nominal variable, is for mutual exclusive, but not ordered, categories. 
    >
    > -- [<cite>GraphPad FAQ</cite>](http://www.graphpad.com/support/faqid/1089/)

    > ... you organize your data in non-numeric categories that cannot be ranked or compared quantitatively.
    >- Examples:
    >   - Different colors of shirts
    >   - Different types of fruits
    >   - Different genres of music
    >
    > -- [<cite>datapine - Asking the Right Data Analysis Questions</cite>](http://www.datapine.com/blog/data-analysis-questions/)

2. Ordinal
    >A ordinal variable, is one where the order matters but not the difference between values. 
    >
    > -- [<cite>GraphPad FAQ</cite>](http://www.graphpad.com/support/faqid/1089/)

3. Interval
    >A interval variable is a measurement where the difference between two values is meaningful. 
    >
    > -- [<cite>GraphPad FAQ</cite>](http://www.graphpad.com/support/faqid/1089/)

    > ... in this type of scale, data is grouped into categories with order and equal distance between these categories.
    >
    >Direct comparison is possible. Adding and subtracting is possible, but you cannot multiply or divide the variables. 
    >
    > -- [<cite>datapine - Asking the Right Data Analysis Questions</cite>](http://www.datapine.com/blog/data-analysis-questions/)

4. Ratio
    >A ratio variable, has all the properties of an interval variable, and also has a clear definition of 0.0. When the variable equals 0.0, there is none of that variable. Variables like height, weight, enzyme activity are ratio variables.
