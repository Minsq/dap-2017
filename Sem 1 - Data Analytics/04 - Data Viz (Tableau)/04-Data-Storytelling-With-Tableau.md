# Data Storytelling With Tableau

## Objectives

- [ ] Learn what Data Storytelling is about
- [ ] Learn yourself some basic Data Storytelling with Tableau
- [ ] Tell a simple story using data and tableau

## Do I Need Stats or Coding Background?

You don't need a lot of it. It's basically just about understanding data at a very intuitive level and using that intuition to share a story with others. If it's overly complex, you probably got it wrong - how are you going to sell a story to hundreds of other people then?
