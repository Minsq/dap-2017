## HELLO BEAUTIFUL.
I hope you have fun with the first python basic lesson. If you haven't complete the first [Python Basic Lesson](https://github.com/smubia/dap-2017/blob/master/Sem%201%20-%20Data%20Analytics/02%20-%20Python%20Basics/python-syntax.md), please do so before you embark on this lesson. This week, we would go more indepth into python, here are the following things that you would be learning.

- [ ] Data Cleaning using Microsoft Excel
- [ ] Data Cleaning using Python Pandas

## Before we get started
**Remember!** 

**For those who just started programming,** I would like to tell you that the journey is going to be a tough, but believe me, it is going to be quite rewarding. Do note that this week would be very heavy for you guys . If you are struggling, may I suggest that you do the following - 1. State in the group that you wish to have a Python enrichment lesson over the weekends, 2. Request help from someone in the group, 3. Learn by yourself over the weekends.

**For people who think you already know python**, please use *this link (not released yet)* for a Python Checklist, if you able to complete everything without the need of googling, you may try either the mini projects or you can try more advanced topics of Data Analytics. But **PLEASE donâ€™t neglect your group if they are able to understand or not occasionally.**
