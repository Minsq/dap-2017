# Introduction to Data Analytics
*Written by: Long, Tze Yiing, Gabriel, Michael, Core Team 17*


# HELLO BEAUTIFUL PEOPLE :information_desk_person:
Welcome to the first co-learning program. In today's session, this would be an introduction to make sure that everyone is on page on what to expect about data analytics. This lesson would be quite dry as there is alot of articles and videos to watch with little hands on, but don't worry. It would only get better from here!

we would hope to achieve these following objectives:

- [ ] Understanding the applications and usefuleness of Data Analytics
- [ ] Know and understand each step of the data science process
- [ ] Know how to ask the right questions
- [ ] Know where to get practice datasets
- [ ] Know the basics of cleaning datasets with Excel
- [ ] Know how to select the right chart for the right situation.
- [ ] Understand the idea of story-telling using data visualisation


## Getting Started
### Learning Tips
- Watch in 1.25x / 1.5x / 2.0x speed to save time
- Any faster, and you need to download a google chrome extension for it.

## The Data Analytics Process
Let's first understand how is data analytics conducted. Take sometime to understand what it takes to solve a particular problem.

## Data Cleaning
A huge portion of your time when you work in the future is to work on data cleaning. You will learn this in the future chapters.

## Data Visualisation
Let's look at the different data visualisation that is possible. We would be using Data Visualisation in Tableau in the future!
- :book: [D3 - Gallery](https://github.com/d3/d3/wiki/Gallery)
    - [ ] Understand that there are many charts available.
    - [ ] Click on 3 graphs and figure out what is the advantage of using each of the graphs as compared to another graph.
    
- :book: [Visualizing Singapore](http://www.viz.sg/)
    - [ ] Select 1 dashboard out of all the visualisation
    - [ ] Gather some insights from the dashboard or find out something cool from the dashboard. 

## Data Storytelling
You may understand the data and/or visualisation. However, others may not. Data Storytelling is how you convey the visualisation such that it is easy for others to derive insights. We will learn more about this in future classes.
