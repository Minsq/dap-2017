> Data is only as good as it’s presented.
# Welcome, Data warriors. Its time for us to understand what is Data Visualization. 

After we have

- [x] Collected the data
- [x] Processed and cleaned the data
- [x] Explored and modeled it

and have exercised our left side of the brain,


### _Its time to exercise the right side and bring creativity along with its beautiful artistic features into analytics by_

- [ ] Visualizing data

Even the most important analysis and results can be thought of as garbage if noone can see and understand the value of output.

**Visualization is the means by which humans understand complex analytics.**
 
 Visualization enables us to potray our findings in an informative and engaging way to all the stakeholders. Many times our model might get complex due to increase in the complexity of data. Thus at the end, **the way we communicate our data (Visualize our findings)** acts as the key to **actionable insights**.
 
 The example below shows how good visualization of insights converts data into meaningful constructive actions.

 If you are interested in further understanding the importance of data visualization you must look at 
 - [ ] [Data Visualization Is The Future - Here's Why](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dorieclark/2014/03/10/data-visualization-is-the-future-heres-why/#43ed3d341884 "Forbes article")

## Now that we have established that visualization is important in explaining humans the raw data we must look into how to go about doing it. ##
 
  ### There are several data visualization tools: ###
  
* __MS Excel__- We can look [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn749860.aspx) to understand different tools used to visualize data in excel.

* __Tableau__- It is a powerful and easy to pick visualization tool. [Here is the link](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s160/sh/55df4ffc-e7e6-4415-b174-94d683c6048c/b86f4cab4c699943) to compiled notes for self learning Tableau from scratch. 

* __Python__- It becomes easy to visualize data in python with with two exclusive libraries for visualization:
    - _matplotlib_ - Python based plotting library offers matplotlib with a complete 2D support along with limited 3D graphic support. It is useful in producing publication quality figures in interactive environment across platforms. To know more about this library follow this [link](http://matplotlib.org/).
   
   > Following link provides a good guide on visualization in a pdf format:
        [Intro to Visualization via matplotlib ](http://dataiap.github.io/dataiap/lectures/day2.pdf). 
   > While, the following link provides hands on training with matplotlib: [Going from data to chart using matplotlib](http://dataiap.github.io/dataiap/day2/).
   
   - _seaborn_ - Seaborn is a library for creating informative and attractive statistical graphics in python. This library is based on matplotlib. Seaborn offers various features such as built in themes, color palettes, functions and tools to visualize univariate, bivariate, linear regression, matrices of data, statistical time series etc which lets us to build complex visualizations. To know more about this library follow this [link](http://seaborn.pydata.org/).
   
   >Following provides the example of using both matplotlib and seaborn : [demo of Python data visualizations on the Iris dataset using matplotlib and seaborn](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/python-data-visualizations).
   
   Going through the above examples gives a very good experience on starting with python visualizations.
   
   Apart from these tools there are many other tools which we can use to potray our analysis efficiently. Thus, the primary concern should be on asking the right question and developing a model from the data to come up with analysis and insights. 
   
   
 ## But for any given tool there are basic steps we must keep in mind while visualizing the data: ##
 
 ### 1. Select a single message to highlight as a conclusion in your visualization-
This is the most crucial part in story telling and the following action depends upon the quality of this this message. 
In doing so, you must consider the following questions:

#### Who is your audience? ####

*Your audience should be your primary consideration. A chart designed for a group of c level executives will not be appropriate for a group of high school students, and vice versa.*

What’s your reader’s numeracy level? Do they enjoy or fear data? Unless you’re designing charts for a group of economists or statisticians, you can usually leave out details like the effect size, power analysis, and margin of error. Laypeople are often more interested in practical significance (the “so what?” and implications of findings) than in statistical significance.

What’s your reader’s dataviz literacy level? If they’re brand new to dataviz, stick with the traditional charts like pie charts, bar charts, and line charts—otherwise they’ll spend more timing ooh-ing and aah-ing over the chart’s novelty than paying attention to the information contained in the chart.

How much time do they have?
Little time or interest: Simple static chart. Lots of time and interest: Interactive charts.

What types of decisions do they make? What information do they need? What information do they already have? What information are they expecting? How will your chart(s) add value for them?

#### Which chart is right for my data? ####

#### How much precision is necessary? ####

_As the chart creator, you have the freedom (and responsibility) to select how much precision is necessary. Your selection should be well thought-out and intentional. Your decision plays out in two ways: the chart type you select, and how you label the data points._

### 2. Remove the clutter from visualization-
Identifying and removing chart clutter reduces visual noise which allows the audience to focus on the information straight away. Some tips in removing clutter stuffs:
- remove 3-dimensional effects
- remove dark gridlines (use soft gray gridlines or eliminate gridlines when possible)
- use softer color tones except where you want to draw attention. Bright colors can be tiring to look at. Be mindful of your color-blind audience and use tools like the [Coblis Color Blindness Simulator](http://www.color-blindness.com/coblis-color-blindness-simulator/) to determine whether your visual is color-blind friendly.
- unnecessary use of all uppercase text (uppercase text is only necessary when calling attention to an element)

Take a look at this guide to build a cleaner chart in excel : [Build a Better, Cleaner, More Professional Line Chart](http://www.exceltactics.com/build-better-cleaner-professional-line-chart/)

### 3. Highlighting key findings with color-
Key findings should be be easily readable as they help the viewer to understand the graphs and our proposal better. 

### 4. State your takeaway message in the title-
The title should make the viewer realize why they must look at your charts. A good title is generally concise (7-9 words) and attention capturing.

### 5. Understanding Perception in Visualization-
Human perception plays an important role in the area of visualization. An understanding of perception can significantly improve both the quality and the quantity of information being displayed. If you are interested in knowing more about huan perception to make your charts better you can have a look at the following link:

Congratulations on completing the Introduction to Data visualization with hands on practice!

I hope you enjoyed learning about it my fellow warriors as it was a rich and fun experience for me writing it. :smile:
