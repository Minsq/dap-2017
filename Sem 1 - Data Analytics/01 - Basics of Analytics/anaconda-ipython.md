## Verifying Installation
After you have done installation, try to open “Anaconda Navigator”. <br/>![alt text](./anaconda-ipython-img/navigator.png)

If it works, you should be able to see this page. ![alt text](./anaconda-ipython-img/navigator2.png)

But just to be sure, open up "Anaconda Prompt". <br/>![alt text](./anaconda-ipython-img/prompt.png)

Once loaded, write the text, "conda list". It would show you all the packages that you have downloaded for python. <br/>![alt text](./anaconda-ipython-img/prompt2.png)
