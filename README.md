# BIA Curriculum
## Objectives
Each member participating in the Curriculum should graduate with core skills that would be reflected in at least 1 **well-done** project. 
Graduated members would then go on to secure analytics-related internships that are of interest to them, bridging BIA fundamentals with industry experience. After gaining these experiences, they would contribute to the curriculum and help mentor the next-generation of BIA members.

## What is BIA?
### Vision
BIA is a student-organized initiative that is driven to facilitate an accessible co-learning
community aimed towards developing strong competencies in analytics and business intelligence.
### Mission
To help students acquire skills for building solutions for business problems through
student collaboration. At the same time, we strive to ignite passion for Analytics and
leverage opportunities for career development.

## Learning Structure
### What is a Checklist?
A Checklist is a list of resources that readers are meant to read through and understand completely.
A Checklist has its sections split according to importance.
Labels used:
- IMPORTANT
    - Content labelled as IMPORTANT must be completely understood by the reader to proceed on with the curriculum.
- EXTRA
    - Content labelled as EXTRA should be read through at the reader's own leisure, as it will serve to reinforce learnings.
- OPTIONAL
    - Content labelled as OPTIONAL is content that would not affect the reader's comprehension of further material should he/she wish to skip them.

### What is a Notebook?
A Notebook is a Jupyter notebook that is viewed in the Jupyter nbviewer, to walk readers through code usage. 


## Contributing & Style Guide
### Heading Styles
- 1st Headers (#) are to be the title of the guide.
- 2nd Headers (##) are to be subsections of the guide.
- 3rd and 4th Headers (### or more) are to be relevant questions pertaining to the subsection.
    - Example questions:
        - What is Anaconda?
        - How is Anaconda used?
        - What is Numpy?
        - What is the Data Science Process and how is it applied?

### Quotations
All quotations are to be cited with relevant links from where the material was obtained. 

For example, a book:
> This is some really important quotation from an important book about an important topic.
>
> --[Important Link from Where Book Can Be Found (2001)](#)

When stating the Article/Section/Topic title, it is crucial that it concisely explains what the article is about, so that readers will know what the link is about before they click it.

For example, a website:
> This is some really important quotation from an important book about an important topic.
>
> --[Author or Website Name - Article/Section/Topic Title](#)

> This is some really important quotation from an important book about an important topic.
>
> --[Google Blog - How to Google](#)

### Images
Where possible, images should not be within the repo, except for files which need to be annotated.

Images should serve to support information, and should be fully explained and cannot be used in isolation.

### Code Snippets
Always place codeblocks inside quote blocks, and specify where that code snippet was taken from. All content must be supported by a relevant source, and code snippets are not an exception.

For example, a website:
> Some important pointers on how to use the code snippet from the website.
>```
>Some really cool code snippet
>Yea it's really cool!
>```
>Finishing Pointers from the website
>
> --[StackOverflow or Something - Do Something Cool](#)

### Additional/Optional Content
For Additional and Optional, add a label in italics and then list the further readings in bullet points.
Additional Content - Builds and solidifies understanding.
Optional Content - Goes beyond scope of guide.

For example:
>### How is something important done?
>It is done by doing this really important thing that I will now explain
>
>*Further Readings:*
>- Additional Readings
>   - [Some Website - Awesome Content](#)
>   - [Cool stuff - Really Cool](#)
>- Optional Readings
>   - [Really Tough stuff - Tough Topic](#)
>   - [Tough as in like - Super tough](#)
